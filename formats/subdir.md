# subdir

This audio classification format simply derives the label of each audio file based 
on the directory that an audio file resides in. Here is an example:

```
|
+- data
   |
   +- label1
   |  |
   |  +- file11.wav
   |  |
   |  +- file12.wav
   |
   +- label2
   |  |
   |  +- file21.wav
   |  |
   |  +- file22.wav
```
